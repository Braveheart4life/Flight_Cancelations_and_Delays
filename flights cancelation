--1) Query to show all flights taken on 2015-1-2 ONLY:

WITH flightWithDate as (
SELECT *, CONCAT([YEAR], '-', [MONTH], '-', [DAY]) as Full_Date
FROM flights)
SELECT *
FROM flightWithDate
WHERE Full_Date = '2015-1-2'

--2a) Checking for Duplicates in the "FlightS" table (by comparing values in the following columns: YEAR, MONTH, DAY, DAY_OF_WEEK, AIRLINE, 
--FLIGHT_NUMBER, TAIL_NUMBER, ORIGIN_AIRPORT, DESTINATION_AIRPORT, SCHEDULED_DEPATURE, DEPATURE_TIME, DEPARTURE_DELAY, TAXI_OUT)
SELECT 
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
    PARTITION BY 
        [YEAR],
        [MONTH],
        [DAY],
        DAY_OF_WEEK,

        FLIGHT_NUMBER,
        TAIL_NUMBER,
        ORIGIN_AIRPORT,
        DESTINATION_AIRPORT,
        SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE,
        DEPARTURE_TIME,
        DEPARTURE_DELAY,
        TAXI_OUT
    ORDER BY FLIGHT_NUMBER
    ) AS DUPLICATES
FROM flights

--2b) find any duplicate using a common table expression: 
WITH DUPLICATE_CHECKED AS(
SELECT 
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
    PARTITION BY 
        [YEAR],
        [MONTH],

        TAXI_OUT
    ORDER BY FLIGHT_NUMBER
    ) AS DUPLICATES
FROM flights)
SELECT *
    FROM DUPLICATE_CHECKED
    WHERE DUPLICATES > 1

--2c) Query showing distinct dates on the flights table:

WITH flightWithDate as (
SELECT *, CONCAT([YEAR], '-', [MONTH], '-', [DAY]) as Full_Date
    FROM flights)
SELECT DISTINCT Full_Date
    FROM flightWithDate
    ORDER BY Full_Date

--3) How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week?
--a) By month:

SELECT 
    CAST([MONTH]AS INT) AS [MONTH], 
    COUNT(FLIGHT_NUMBER) AS COUNTS
FROM flights
    GROUP BY [MONTH]
    ORDER BY 1
--3b) By day of the week:

SELECT 
    CAST([DAY_OF_WEEK] AS INT) AS [DAY_OF_WEEK], 
    COUNT(FLIGHT_NUMBER) AS COUNTS
FROM flights
    GROUP BY [DAY_OF_WEEK]
    ORDER BY 1

--4) Query that shows how many flights had depature delays:

SELECT 
    [YEAR], 
    COUNT(FLIGHT_NUMBER) AS Count_with_Depature_Delays
FROM flights
WHERE DEPARTURE_DELAY > '0'
GROUP BY [YEAR]
--5) total count of all flights:

SELECT 
    COUNT(FLIGHT_NUMBER) AS Total_Count_Of_FLights
FROM flights

--6) New column that shows month_name:
SELECT 
    *,
    CASE
        WHEN [MONTH] = 1 THEN 'Jan'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 2 THEN 'Feb'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 3 THEN 'Mar'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 4 THEN 'Apr'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 5 THEN 'May'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 6 THEN 'Jun'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 7 THEN 'Jul'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 8 THEN 'Aug'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 9 THEN 'Sep'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 10 THEN 'Oct'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 11 THEN 'Nov'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 12 THEN 'Dec'
    END AS Month_Name
FROM flights

--7) Show the % depature delays through out the year:
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN [MONTH] = 1 THEN 'Jan'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 2 THEN 'Feb'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 3 THEN 'Mar'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 4 THEN 'Apr'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 5 THEN 'May'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 6 THEN 'Jun'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 7 THEN 'Jul'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 8 THEN 'Aug'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 9 THEN 'Sep'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 10 THEN 'Oct'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 11 THEN 'Nov'
        WHEN [MONTH] = 12 THEN 'Dec'
    END AS Month_Name,
    COUNT(FLIGHT_NUMBER) AS No_Flights_Delayed
FROM flights
WHERE DEPARTURE_DELAY > 0
GROUP BY [MONTH]
ORDER BY 2

--8) show cancellations due to weather:

SELECT 
    [MONTH],
    count(CANCELLED) AS Cancelled_Due_To_Weather
FROM flights
where CANCELLATION_REASON = 'B'
GROUP BY [MONTH]

--9) Show reasons why flights where canceled

SELECT 
    DISTINCT flights.AIRLINE,
    COUNT(flights.AIRLINE) AS Total_Count_Of_FLights,
    cancellation_codes.CANCELLATION_DESCRIPTION
FROM flights 
INNER JOIN cancellation_codes ON
flights.CANCELLATION_REASON = cancellation_codes.CANCELLATION_REASON
GROUP BY 
    flights.AIRLINE, 
    cancellation_codes.CANCELLATION_DESCRIPTION
